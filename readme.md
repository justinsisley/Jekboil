### What is Jekboil?

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is nice. It's simple to use, and goes hand-in-hand with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

Here's the thing: I prefer [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) to [SASS/SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/). I use both on a daily basis, but when it comes down to it, I'm like LESS. Therefore, this Jekyll site boilerplate uses LESS.

I'm also a [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/) power user, and while it's completely unnecessary if my project uses little or no JavaScript, I prefer to have requirejs ready to rock in case a project is, or becomes, JavaScript heavy.

I round out the dependencies with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), which, in my humble opinion, is the linchpin of an efficient and thoroughly enjoyable web development workflow.

I'm not concerned with evangelizing any of the technologies used in this project. These are just the things that have been making me happy for the last couple of years.
